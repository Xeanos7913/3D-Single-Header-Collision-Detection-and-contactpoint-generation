# Collision-Detection-and-contactpoint-generation
A simple c++ header-only single file that uses the Separating Axis Theorem (SAT) to detect collisions between two Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBB) and generate contact points for vertex-face collisions and edge-edge collisions.
Features :
-> 3D.
-> Single header, easily expandable
-> uses GLM for mathematics
